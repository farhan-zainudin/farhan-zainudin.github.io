  This article pretty much sums up my experience within the past 3 months when I am doing my internship with Maybank. It's my first time writing an article here. Your comments and suggestions are highly appreciated.

Last Friday, 30th November 2018, marks my last day in Menara Maybank as an intern. The past 3 months have been such a wonderful journey. The moment when I got the offer letter, I was shocked, ehh what is this ??? "Implementation, Transaction Banking, Group Global Banking". I have no idea what will I do in this (Cash Management) department, I have no idea if this is related to my course and I have no idea if this will be a good thing for me. After seeking advices from various people, my seniors, scholar guide from Yayasan Peneraju and my supervisor from A.P.U. I decided to take the offer with an open mind. Curious and excited at the same time.

As my internship started, just imagine someone who's been studying IT for the past 3 years went into finance... Only god knows how aliens was the financial terms for me. It was hard for me to catch up at first, but the seniors was there in every step. They were very helpful in explaining and answering all my questions. They were there if I were stuck in something. they will be there if I am struggling with clients. Long story short, they will always be there to help me when I need them. I am grateful for having them as my colleague and family.

If someone ask me whether I felt regret for not going to IT companies for my internship, the answer will always be "NO!" This experience have open my mind, that someone should always try to get out of their comfort zone. We will never knows what Gods have planned for us, explore new things, explore new industries and then you will only know whether it was a good choice or not. I will end this with a quote from Asim Qureshi.

> "To succeed in life you need to try.  
  Trying usually gets you nowhere but if you keep at it, you keep trying in all aspects of your life,  
  it will make you succeed in ways you never imagined possible." - Asim Qureshi
