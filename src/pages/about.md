Hey welcome to my personal blog. I am a Technology Engineer based in Malaysia with 3+ years of experience.

Cloud Native Architecture, Distributed Systems and DevOps movement have been something that piqued my interest throughout my career.

I am a firm believer in Continuous Learning and try to share my knowledge with others as much as possible.
